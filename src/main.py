#COMMENTS:
# The relationship between Scroll_Depth and Session_Duration suggests that engaging content is able to keep users on the site longer.
# As there is a moderate correlation between Click Through Rate and Conversion Rate variables, there is potential to increase conversions by improving the post-click experience for a user.
# We can look into analyzing the pages a user lands on after clicking through and optimize them to better align with the user’s intent and streamline the conversion process.

figure.write_image('../output/Click_through_rate_vs_Conversion_rate.png')

#COMMENTS:
# The linear trendline is almost flat, suggesting a weak or no strong correlation between CTR and Conversion Rate. This indicates that higher click-through rates do not necessarily lead to higher conversion rates.
# The linear regression line is relatively flat, which means that overall, there is no clear upward or downward trend linking CTR to Conversion Rate. 
# This analysis emphasizes that while CTR is an important metric, it may not be the sole determinant of conversion success, and other factors should be examined for a more holistic view of user behavior.

figure.write_image('../output/Click_Through_Rate_by_Theme.png')

#COMMENTS:
# Both themes have similar distributions across most CTR ranges, with no extreme deviation for either theme, indicating that users interact similarly with both themes in terms of click behavior.
# The histogram shows that no theme significantly outperforms the other across all CTR ranges, suggesting that the choice of theme (Light vs. Dark) does not have a considerable impact on overall CTR behavior.
# Since both themes perform similarly, it's crucial to look beyond just the theme to identify other variables contributing to better CTR performance.

#Conversion Rate Histogram
figure = go.Figure()

figure.add_trace(go.Histogram(x=light_theme_data['Conversion Rate'], name='Light Theme', opacity=0.6, nbinsx=20))
figure.add_trace(go.Histogram(x=dark_theme_data['Conversion Rate'], name='Dark Theme', opacity=0.6, nbinsx=20))

)

figure.show()

figure.write_image('../output/Conversion_Rate_by_Theme.png')

#COMMENTS:
# Both themes seem to perform fairly similarly in most conversion rate ranges, with slight variations between them.
# While the Dark Theme has a slight advantage in lower conversion rates, the Light Theme appears to be performing better overall at the higher conversion rates.
# Since the Light Theme performs slightly better at higher conversion rates, a focused approach on enhancing user experience for Dark Theme users at these higher levels should be considered.

#Bounce Rate
figure = go.Figure()
figure.add_trace(go.Box(y=light_theme_data['Bounce Rate'], name='Light Theme'))
figure.add_trace(go.Box(y=dark_theme_data['Bounce Rate'], name='Dark Theme'))

)

figure.show()

figure.write_image('../output/Bounce_Rate_by_Theme.png')

#COMMENTS:
# The median bounce rate for both themes is quite similar, indicating that the typical bounce behavior is comparable regardless of the theme. However, the interquartile range and the whiskers differ between the two themes.
# The similar medians and ranges imply that theme preference might not have a significant influence on overall bounce rate.
# The wider variability in the Dark Theme bounce rates suggests that some users disengage more frequently than others and viceversa for the Lighe theme.

#Scroll Depth Rate
figure = go.Figure()
figure.add_trace(go.Box(y=light_theme_data['Scroll_Depth'], name='Light Theme'))
figure.add_trace(go.Box(y=dark_theme_data['Scroll_Depth'], name='Dark Theme'))

)

figure.show()

figure.write_image('../output/Scroll_Depth_Rate_by_Theme.png')

#COMMENT:
# The median scroll depth for both themes is quite similar, indicating that users on both themes tend to scroll to roughly the same depth on average.
# While the Light Theme has a more consistent scroll depth range, with the majority of users clustering around the same area, the Dark Theme users exhibit a wider range of scrolling behavior, suggesting that some users are more engaged while others scroll less before leaving the page.

#Segmented Analysis

figure = px.bar(age_data, x = age_data.index, y = 'Conversion Rate', title = 'Conversion Rate by Age Group')
figure.show()
figure.write_image('../output/Conversion_rate_by_Age_Group.png')

#COMMENT:
# The older users (66-100) seem to engage more deeply, which could mean that they find value in the offerings or that the product/service resonates with their needs.
# There is a drop in conversion for the 26-35 group and it is typically a busy demographic—people are working, managing families, or have other distractions.
# By optimizing the user experience for mobile devices, providing exclusive promotions or offers can increase engagement.

#A/B testing for Purchases

print("Light Theme Conversion Rate:", light_theme_conversion_rate)
print("Dark Theme Conversion Rate:", dark_theme_conversion_rate)
print("A/B Testing - z-statistic:", zstat, " p-value:", pval)

#COMMENTS:
# The conversion rate for the Light Theme (53.09%) is slightly higher than the Dark Theme (50.39%).
# However, the difference between the two conversion rates is not statistically significant, as indicated by the p-value of 0.393 (higher than the typical significance threshold of 0.05).
# This means that we cannot reject the null hypothesis—there is no strong evidence that the Light Theme has a significantly better conversion rate than the Dark Theme.

#A/B testing for Session Duration
light_theme_session_duration = light_theme_data['Session_Duration']
dark_theme_session_duration = dark_theme_data['Session_Duration']

# Calculate the average session duration for both themes
light_theme_avg_duration = light_theme_session_duration.mean()

# Print the average session duration for both themes
print("Light Theme Average Session Duration:", light_theme_avg_duration)
print("Dark Theme Average Session Duration:", dark_theme_avg_duration)

# Perform two-sample t-test for session duration
tstat, pval = stats.ttest_ind(light_theme_session_duration, dark_theme_session_duration)
print("A/B Testing for Session Duration - t-statistic:", tstat, " p-value:", pval)

#COMMENTS:
# The average session duration for the Light Theme (930.83 seconds) is slightly higher than for the Dark Theme (919.48 seconds).
# However, this difference is very small and, more importantly, not statistically significant (p-value of 0.724).
# The high p-value indicates that the differences in session duration between the two themes are likely due to random chance, and the themes don't significantly influence how long users stay on the site.

#Chi-Square test
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(data['Purchases'], data['Theme'])
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)
print('Chi-square test for Purchases vs Theme - chi2:', chi2, 'p-value:', p)

#COMMENTS:
# The Chi-square test examines the association between theme (Light vs. Dark) and whether users made a purchase.
# The p-value of 0.430 indicates that there is no significant association between the theme and purchases.
# Hence, the theme a user interacts with does not significantly affect their likelihood to make a purchase.
